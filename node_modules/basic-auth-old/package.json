See [http://expressjs.com/api.html#middleware](http://expressjs.com/api.html#middleware)\n\n### Why?\n\nI needed just very basic auth for NodeJS and I couldn't find a module that worked.\n\nTo install:\n\n```\nnpm install basic-auth-old\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar auth = require('basic-auth')({\n  name: 'Auth Box Name',\n  accounts: [\n    'username:password',\n    'user2:pass2'\n  ]\n})\n```\n\nThis is by no means a secure system. This is good if you have a page that just needs to prevent some unauthorized access (such as an intranet).",
